    'faq_index_q16' => 'How can you get the latest news & technical update about MOAC？',
    'faq_index_a1_text1' => 'MOAC is a revolutionary platform with a Multi-Blockchain smart contract and P2P service network to efficiently build and scale decentralized applications. By leveraging Multi-Blockchain sharding, the MOAC platform increases system capacity and performance, reduces transaction fees for smart contracts, and incentivizes mobile and desktop users to compete for processing rewards.',
    'faq_index_a1_text2' => 'The platform is a Multi-Blockchain software and deployment service solution for rapid development of decentralized applications (Dapps) and smart contracts on a scalable P2P service network. By using an advanced layered architecture for asynchronous smart contracts and a variety of configurable consensus systems (including “proof of work” and “proof of stake”), the MOAC platform enhances existing Dapps with additional functionality, and scalability solutions. This advancement increases processing speed by several levels of magnitude (10-100x) and sets a new market standard for transactional efficiency, while optimizing decentralization mechanisms and overall security.',
    'faq_index_a2_text1' => 'The MOAC platform was designed to increase and maximize blockchain network performance using node-based computing power and allowing for on-demand, timed, and savable smart contract processing. The platform provides tools and APIs to application developers to quickly build complex Dapps that can leverage both “proof of work” and “proof of stake” and other scalable consensus systems on a decentralized P2P service network. In turn, and as a result of increased volume and speed of processing, the new MotherChain standard incentivizes the user community and drives increased participation - including users with low processing power (i.e., mobile users).',
    'faq_index_a3_text1' => 'Existing blockchain technologies and platforms suffer from steep learning curves, unnecessary complexity, and high usage fees all of which impact adoption and scalability. Technically, existing platforms have low transactions-per-second, have fixed consensus models, and are not able to quickly adapt to the ever growing needs of developers. These blockchain platforms are also alienated from each other, and unable to communicate effectively with other cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, and blockchain systems, creating a highly segregated blockchain marketplace. To make matters even more complicated, most blockchains are difficult to upgrade, and split participation inefficiently between users.',
    'faq_index_a3_text2' => 'MOAC has addressed the primary inefficiencies of existing blockchain platforms by developing a Multi-Blockchain architecture that lowers Dapps costs, provides for scalability, and reduces development complexity while also increasing transaction speeds and volume using sharding. MOAC leverages multiple blockchains within its platform, including MotherChain (Proof of Work), a Dapp Chain (Proof of Stake or any other consensus protocol, see below sections) for scalable transactions, Microchains for Smart Contracts, and Cross-Chain capabilities for interacting between multiple blockchains and cryptocurrencies for improved efficiency, and scalability.',
    'faq_index_a3_text3' => 'By separating balance transfer and smart contracts, the MOAC Platform can outperform Ethereum by 100x transactions per second using an advanced Mutli-blockchain system including Microchains and sharding.',
    'faq_index_a4_text1' => 'First, MOAC uses blockchain sharding to speed up the TPS, making it an attractive platform for DAPP developers and users.',
    'faq_index_a4_text2' => 'Secondly, it redefines how DAPP developers and users interact with the system from the monetization standpoint. Most existing systems assume unfair burden on DAPP users: not only DAPP do they have to pay each transaction fee, but they also have a steep learning curve to climb on how blockchain works. With MOAC, there is no need to know anything about the underlying system before using the DAPP, and no need to acquire any underlying token unless the use case itself really commands it.',
    'faq_index_a4_text3' => 'Thirdly, MOAC adds new ways to redistribute tokens to a wide range of participants, thus further supporting decentralization. Thanks to the second layer’s mining, each DAPP will pay its miners continuously all throughout the lifetime of the DAPP. And because the second layer’s mining does not need to calculate a random number, every CPU (including mobile devices) can participate as potential nodes. This greatly encourages participants in masses to provide the processing power to support more DAPPs and get incentivized accordingly.',
    'faq_index_a4_text4' => 'Finally, since DAPPs are deployed in a virtual machine of the developer’s choice, they do not require additional programming. MOAC is able to run existing Ethereum smart contracts with lower fees, and developers can leverage the MOAC API to expand their existing smart contract with additional functionality without having to learn how to program on the blockchain.',
    'faq_index_a5_text1' => 'MOAC Website:moacfoundation.org',
    'faq_index_a6_text1' => 'The MotherChain is a Proof of Work blockchain, similar to Ethereum, that handles data storage and compute processing for smart contracts and Dapps. On the MOAC Platform, the MotherChain is the public blockchain network that processes balance transfers, blockchain operation, consensus, and data access. The MOAC Platform also supports other consensus models.',
    'faq_index_a7_text1' => 'On top of the MotherChain is the MOAC Dapp Chain which uses a Proof of Stake consensus model specifically for scalable rapid high volume transactions. The advantage of a Proof of Stake system is that it is fully scalable for enterprise-level volume, it is energy efficient, and supports varied transactions. It also increases verification capacity proportional to nodes on the network, and enables microtransactions within Dapps without having to constantly access the MotherChain.',
    'faq_index_a7_text2' => 'In addition to Proof of Stake and Proof of Work blockchains, the MOAC Platform can also support additional plug-and-play consensus systems such as Proof of Activity, Proof of Burn, Proof of Elapsed Time, etc.',
    'faq_index_a8_text1' => 'A Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm is an economic measure to deter and ultimately prohibit third-party interference, including denial of service attacks and other service and network abuse such as spam. By requiring some work from the service requester, usually equating to commited processing time by a computer for completing specific processing tasks, erroneous system threats are eliminated.',
    'faq_index_a8_text2' => 'Proof of Stake (PoS) is a type of algorithm by which a blockchain network aims to achieve distributed consensus (the agreement system that provides accountability and verification of transactions). Instead of processing large amounts of data like a Proof of Work system, a Proof of Stake system relies on validator nodes within a network to verify transactions. In Proof of Stake blockchains, the creator of the next block is chosen via various combinations of random selection based on factors such as wealth, or age (i.e., the stake).',
    'faq_index_a9_text1' => 'MOAC implements Microchains on a per smart contract basis, providing for efficiency, and scalability above and beyond existing solutions. The MOAC Platform uses Microchains to separate processing tasks and isolate blockchain functions from business logic for each individual smart contract.

With a pioneering Multi-Blockchain architecture, MOAC not only addresses the performance and cost issues with existing blockchain systems, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, but also introduces new features that minimize the barrier to entry for developers, users, businesses, and the entirety of the blockchain ecosystem. The new platform achieves this by using a layered Multi-Blockchain architecture, blockchain sharding, MicroChain™ Smart Contracts, and Cross-Chain capabilities.',
